<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This project (proposed by frontendmentor.io) is based on an application that allows users to interact with a feedback and proposal dashboard for a specific product. Users can create, edit, and delete feedback, as well as comment and reply to feedback from other users, and vote on proposals. The original idea was not designed for a multi-user system, so adjustments were made to accommodate this. However, it does not include moderation of interactions or role changes in feedback, which should be handled through an administration system. Given the project’s purely demonstrative and educational nature, certain aspects that would be considered in a real project of this type are not addressed. The project structures a full stack application but uses Next.js server functions, eliminating the need for a separate API for database interactions. Authentication is handled using credentials only for illustrative purposes, though it can be improved by implementing multiple authentication systems.
